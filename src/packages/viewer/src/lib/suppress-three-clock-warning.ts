/**
 * Suppresses the `THREE.Clock: This module has been deprecated` warning
 * emitted by three.js r183+ on every `new THREE.Clock()` call.
 *
 * We don't instantiate `Clock` ourselves — `@react-three/fiber` 9.x
 * (current stable) creates one internally per `<Canvas>` mount. The
 * migration to `THREE.Timer` lands in R3F 10.x (still alpha).
 *
 * Uses three's `setConsoleFunction` hook so we don't touch `console.warn`
 * globally. Only the exact Clock deprecation message is suppressed; all
 * other three.js logs (including TSL stack-trace warnings) pass through
 * untouched.
 *
 * Runs in production as well as dev — the suppressed message is a pure
 * deprecation notice with no user-actionable content.
 *
 * REMOVAL: safe to delete once `@react-three/fiber` no longer constructs
 * `new THREE.Clock()`. To verify after an R3F upgrade:
 *   grep -n "new THREE.Clock" node_modules/@react-three/fiber/dist/*.js
 * No hits → delete this file and its import in components/viewer/index.tsx.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/issues/213
